        <p>Sometimes, all I think about is you</p>
        <p>Late nights in the middle of June</p>
        <p>Heat waves been fakin' me out</p>

        <p>You just need a better life than this</p>
        <p>You need somethin' I can never give</p>
        <p>Fake water all across the road</p>
        <p>It's gone now, the night has come, but</p>
        <p>Sometimes, all I think about is you</p>
        <p>Late nights in the middle of June</p>
        <p>Heat waves been fakin' me out</p>
        <p>Can't make you happier now</p>
        <p>You can't fight it, you can't breathe</p>
        <p>You say something so lovin', but</p>
        <p>Now I gotta let you go</p>
        <p>You'll be better off in someone new</p>
        <p>I don't wanna be alone</p>
        <p>You know it hurts me too</p>
        <p>You look so broken when you cry</p>
        <p>One more and then I say goodbye</p>
        <p>Sometimes, all I think about is you</p>
        <p>Late nights in the middle of June</p>
        <p>Heat waves been fakin' me out</p>
        <p>Can't make you happier now</p>
